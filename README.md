News is dying. It gets less viewership year after year, and that's because it's being replaced by short-form entertainment. My application is the first to turn news into something truly short form, making news a thing of the present for new generations.

The application takes recent news, applies AI to them to find the shortest, punchiest way to present the information, and then feeds it to the user in a TikTok- or Instragram Reels-like scrolling mechanism. The recent news will be found by using NewsCatcher API (https://newscatcherapi.com/).

Users have the choice between scrolling through national news or local news.

The more informed people are about the news, the better-educated they are to make decisions, the more they are able to change about their own life, and the safer they are. My app, Leads, will bring news to the 21st century.
